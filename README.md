# fly-tracking
I am doing a research to monitor a fruit fly's brain activity when the fly is moving on its daily routine. It requires the fly not contraint under the microscope, the fly's movement will be canceled by placing the fly on a mobile platform moving in xyz directions, so that the fly will always remain right under the microscope. However, due to the sensitivity of our microscope, a slight movement of the fly will cause the microscope to fail to focus. And there is 3ms lag in the platform system caused by USB communication delay, Image acquisition delay, etc., delay in platform movement causes displacement of fruit flies cannot be completely canceled.

We hope we can predict the fly's movement and use the prediction as input of the platform to counter the delay of the platform. This repo includes the code and trained model of the fly's movement prediction.
